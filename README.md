# pythonsentencetokenizer
Attempt to make a sentence breaker using Python language and the opensource "nltk" python package.
'punkt' is the workhorse used for breaking/segmenting/tokenizing the sentences.
Project was built using pyinstaller :) a very nice package to compile any .py script to a redritibutable.
This project is in a rudimentary stage.Expect more edits!!
